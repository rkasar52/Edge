
Requirements:
— Goal: the main objective is to design a (fictional) case study where you will provide business value using data and analytics. An important point here is that “value” can stem from different factors. One possibility, of course, is to build the best of the best models. Another possibility is to demonstrate the value of “new data”, that is, the value of a comprehensive dataset as opposed to a more restricted one. Another possibility is to open a new application of analytics by asking a new question and providing recommendations based on data-driven results. Of course, these items are not mutually exclusive nor collectively exhaustive. The point is, you do not have to develop a new machine learning algorithm to do a successful in the project.

— Setting: in any case, please make sure to define the context clearly. I think the easiest way to describe it is to imagine yourself in a consulting environment (it can be external or internal consulting), and to design a fictional 6-week study. Who is your client organization? Who is the lead of the project, and what is his/her role in the client organization? Who else is working on the project on the client side? What are their expectations, experience, attitudes, etc.? What is the context of the project? If everything goes very well, what will be the impact on the organization? You do not have to dive too deep into the specific answers to these questions, but these are the types of questions that can help you frame your main questions and design your analysis accordingly.

— Scope: a term project is not a multi-year research project. In terms of overall scope, I view it as “one to two homework assignments”. If you look at the HW prompts, we start from a problem, we explore a dataset, we build models, we get results, and we provide recommendations. This is the recommended structure for your projects as well. Now, a project is much more work than a HW because you are asking the questions as opposed to merely answering them, so there is some exploration and some back-and-forth to expect, but keep these guidelines in mind. In general, my advice for the project is to strive to complete a “simple” project first, with a dataset you have in hand, with a manageable question, and without using the most complex models. If you have time after that, you can always work toward improving it, but at least you will have a good output that way. Just my two cents :)

— Proposal: the project proposal (due on November 5) should be a short document (1 to 2 pages) describing the setting of your problem, the data you will be using, and your plan for the analysis. If you are in a position to include some results from an exploratory data analysis or some early modeling efforts, please go ahead, but this is not at all required. If you do not have a dataset and are not confident that you will get one by that time, please let Kayla and me know.

— Presentations: in lieu of presentations, we will be holding interviews to make the format more interactive. Namely each team will interview another team. The interviewing team will play the role of a team that includes the project leader—a major decision-maker in the client organization. The interviewed team will first provide an overview of its work for 2–3 minutes (hence, you shall not prepare more than 2–3 slides), and then engage in a discussion. We will go over the format in more detail later on.
